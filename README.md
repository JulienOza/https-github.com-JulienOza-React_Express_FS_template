# Simple React Vite & Express fullstack template

 My own minimal fullstack template for personnal projects purposes.
 Feel free to fork and personnalize it at your convenience.
 Special thanks to [Florence](https://github.com/FlorenceBuchelet/), whose great work on her project "Tamilochi" served as a model for the back-end part.

## Stack

### Frontend :
- Vite
- SASS
- React Router
- Concurrently

### Backend : 
- Express
- Nodemon
- Dotenv
- MySQL2
- Cors

## How to launch
### On first start
- clone this repo
- in the /frontend and /backend folder: copy the ".env.sample" files as ".env" and edit them with your own environment variables
- run `npm run start:first`
This will install everything you need in front and back, initiate the mock database and run your project.

### Simple launch
- run `npm run start`
This will run your front and back folders.
